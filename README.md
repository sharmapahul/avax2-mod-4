# DegenToken

DegenToken is an ERC20 token smart contract implemented in Solidity. It allows for minting, burning, and transferring of tokens. Additionally, it provides functionalities for retrieving token balances, transferring tokens, and redeeming tokens for specific items.

## Features

- Minting of tokens by the contract owner.
- Burning of tokens by the owner or any token holder.
- Transfer of tokens between addresses.
- Retrieval of token balance for a specific address.
- Redemption of tokens for predefined items.

## Prerequisites

- Solidity compiler version ^0.8.18
- OpenZeppelin library for ERC20 token implementation

## Installation

To deploy the contract, import it into your Solidity development environment. Make sure to have the required Solidity compiler and OpenZeppelin library installed. Compile and deploy the contract to your desired Ethereum network.

## Usage

### Constructor

The constructor initializes the ERC20 token with the name "Degen" and symbol "DGN". It also sets the initial owner of the contract.

### Minting

The `mint` function allows the owner to mint new tokens and assign them to a specified address.

### Burning

The contract inherits from `ERC20Burnable`, allowing both the owner and any token holder to burn tokens.

### Balance Retrieval

The `getBalance` function returns the token balance of the caller.

### Transfer Tokens

The `transferTokens` function allows token holders to transfer tokens to another address. It checks for the availability of tokens and requires approval before transferring.

### Item Redemption

The `RedeemToken` function enables users to redeem tokens for specific items. The items available for redemption are:
1. Hat (Cost: 200 tokens)
2. Shirt (Cost: 100 tokens)
3. Heart (Cost: 50 tokens)

### Storage Item Details

The `StoreItem` function provides a list of items available for redemption.
